          <p>OverMap was born out of a love for cities and walking around them. Every city has a character that is defined by its various physical attributes. The width of sidewalks, the size of pedestrian crossings, the angles at intersections, the length of city blocksâ€”all these attributes combine to create a unique impression of a city when you're moving around it.</p>
          <p>OverMap is a project to compare cities by these attributes. I've occasionally pulled out Google Maps and resized browser windows side-by-side to try to get a sense for these physical attributes, but it never gave me the satisfaction I imagined you'd get from pulling out two physical maps and laying them on top of each other. I wanted to get a true sense for comparing the geometry of two places. How do Chicago city blocks compare to New York ones? Was does a dense European city look like when overlaid on a sprawling American one? So I made OverMap.</p>
          <p>I also wanted a fun coding project, and this website presented plenty of little challenges that I really enjoyed. Hopefully this site brings you a little joy too.</p>
